## Mutual Fund Analysis and Investment Insights

     About the Project

         This project provides an in-depth analysis of mutual fund and company stock performance to assist in identifying optimal investment opportunities. The project involves cleaning and
         processing stock price data, visualizing trends, and analyzing key financial metrics like growth rates, return on investment (ROI), and volatility. Additionally, it explores the
         potential returns of monthly investments in selected mutual funds over different time horizons.

     Key Features

         1) Data Preprocessing:

              Conversion of date columns into a datetime format for accurate time-series analysis.
              Handling missing values using forward-fill methods to maintain data integrity.

         2) Visualization:

              Trend analysis of stock prices across various companies using interactive line plots.
              Comparison of risks and expected returns between individual companies and selected mutual funds using horizontal bar charts.
              Projection of future investment values based on average ROI, displayed with a line and marker plot.

         3) Performance Metrics:

              Calculation of stock volatility to determine risk levels.
              Identification of companies with the highest growth rates and returns on investment.
              Selection of optimal mutual funds based on ROI and volatility thresholds.

         4) Investment Simulation:

              Calculation of future values of periodic investments based on mutual fund performance.
              Assessment of potential ROI over investment periods of 1, 3, 5, and 10 years.
